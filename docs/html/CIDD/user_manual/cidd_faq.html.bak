<B> 1.1 Fonts do not fit in the buttons. The menus and panels look
	  terrible and some elements are obscured. What is going on and,
	  most importantly, how can I fix it? </B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
   A: The XView toolkit that CIDD uses as a GUI layer has a relatively
	  ambiguous specification for its default font. It finds a
	  really big font because your X server lists big fonts first
	  when it sets up the default X font path and XView does
	  not scale the size of the widgets to fit the fonts.
	  <P> The current, prefered workaround is to add specific Openwindows font specifications
	  into your .Xresources file: 
	  <UL>
		<LI>OpenWindows.MonospaceFont: fixed
		<LI>OpenWindows.RegularFont: 6x13
		<LI>OpenWindows.BoldFont: 6x13bold
	  </UL>
	  <P> Merge this into your current resource set with: <B> 'xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources' </B>
	  After editing your ~/.Xresources file. 

	  <P> Another Simple way is to simply add a specific font on the command line;
	  <BR> <B> CIDD -font lucidasans-bold-12 -p CIDD.myparamfile </B>

	  <P> Another simple way to fix this problem is to reverse the order
	  of the 75 dpi and 100 dpi font directories in your XServer
	  configuration file, where it sets the default  font path,
	  and then restart the X server.  You'll need root privilege
	  to modify the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4* file.
	  <BR>(*It may have a different name on your system)
	 <BR>You also may have to
	  edit /etc/X11/fs/config if your system is using athe X
	  font server and reverse the 100 and 75 fonts in the path
	  order. Restart the X font server via '/etc/init.d/xfs restart'

	  <P>You can also set your individual font path using 'xset
	  fp=...'.  Use 'xset -q' to query what your X settings are
	  currently.
	  <P> <B> Example: <PRE>
xset fp= "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi"
	  </PRE> </B>
	  <P> Control can be had via the OpenWindows X resources
	  which control much of the look of the GUI, including which fonts
	  are used.  See 'man 7x xview' on a Linux box with the libraries
	  installed for detailed information. Skip over the first Usage
	  section to the section on 'Command Line Resource Arguments'.
	  Place these in your .Xresources file or use 'xrdb' from the
	  command line.

<A name="Q3.1"> 
<B> 3.1  What is the difference between the "terrain" and "landuse" fields?A </B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
<P>   A: "Terrain" must be a Mdv file/URL which contains
   elevation data. It is used primarily to obscure data above a particular
   elevation. For example, looking at the 900Mb plot over Colorado, or a
   cross section of model data, on pressure layers, over a mountain range.
   <BR>
    Note: Niles Oien has <A
   HREF="http://www.rap.ucar.edu/~oien/terrain/makeTerrain.html">
    instructions </A> on preparing these data.

<P>   Landuse, is gridded data that is rendered underneath all other
   data. Many choose to use the same URL as their terrain data and
   use a color scale to provide a false colored topological map. Many
   choose to use a colorscale that uses "ocean blue" for elevations of
   0 meters. This works pretty well, unless you are looking at coastal
   areas where your map will show "Ocean" far inland. A better approach,
   and much more pleasing to the eye is to take a geo-referenced image,
   like a geotiff and run it through <b>Image2Mdv</b> to produce an Mdv
   encapsulated geo-tiff, which CIDD and JADE know how to render. Shaded
   relief images are available from the USGS that contain a combination
   of topological features as well as land category to produce very
   pleasing maps. There are detailed notes in the Image2Mdv source code
   directory which illustrate its use.

 <P> Note: Landuse can refer to a non-static data set. For example you could
   use a WMS Server(via WMS2MdvServer), or a Mdv Server to feed it live
   data showing maps that include up-to-date- traffic, flood coverage,
   satellite imagery, etc.

<A name="Q3.2"> 
<B> 3.2 What do I have to do to render a new SPDB data type?
<BR> "The Insitu Turbulence project would like
 to render the new spdb Edr data type
 in CIDD. What do I need to do?</B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
 <P>If you are using a totally new data type, you'll need to create a Symprod
 server for this new data format. In OO terms - you need to create a vi1G
 method for your new model. This process will translate your binary format
 into lines, text and symbols (Symprod format spdb data) which CIDD renders.
 If you used a pre-existing data format you just need to place the proper
 "SPDB to Symprod Server"  in your URL's. See <A HREF="#Q2.1symprod">
  question 2.1 </a>

 <P>Check out cvs/apps/dsserver/ and look at all the different *2Symprod
 apps. Pick  one with similar data format and/or  and rendering. Copy
 that and create a Edr2Symprod server.  Once this gets built, you can then
 add a config line in CIDD's param files to load and render this product.

 <P>You'll also need to coordinate with Mike Dixon (author of DsServerMgr)
 to add a hook for your new data type into the server manager, so it
 can fire up your new Symprod server automatically.

<A name="Q4.1"> 
<B> 4.1  Data retrival is intermittent. Products don't always appear.  When the # of movie frames gets larger,
	the client requests begin to fail.  For very short movies the requests are all
	successful and I can see all the products, then as the movie gets longer fewer
	and fewer products are successfully gotten.  </B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
   A: The likely cause of this  problem is that the <b> cidd.data_timeout_secs:
   </b> parameter is set too small. Spdb Servers can sometimes take a long
   time to do their work and respond, especially if they have a lot of
   data to process. 
   <P> In some cases it may be advantageous to set up CIDD to request
   SPDB products for each individual frame, rather than requesting data
   which covers the entire movie loop. To enable this, set the parameter;
   <b>short_requests = TRUE;</b> in the &lt;SYMPRODS&gt; section of the parameter
   file. 

   <P> Note:  The 'short requests' mode will often return data quicker, but will
   take a longer time overall to build a movie loop because products which
   appear in more than one movie frame have to be re-requested. Additionally,
   several of the time selection modes become ineffective due to the limited
   storage of product data across time.

   <P> Another possibility is that your DS_COMM_TIMEOUT_MSECS environment
   variable is set too small. The default value is 30,000. (30 sec). 30
   seconds is high enough for most access across the Internet. Unless you
   have reset this, this is probably not an issue.
