<h2> <a name="Summary"> Summary  </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Event Manager is a tool which is used to record and retrieve
weather events. A list of weather events is presented in a list. Specific
information about the selected event is displayed and the user may update
or add to the informatioas and  save the result to disk. Event Manager
works in conjunction with the WSDM displays and the data scrubbing
utilities; Event Manager can be used to send the display to the chosen
event, and one a new event has been added and saved, the data for that
event is retained indefinately. WSDM systems typically have 30 days
of history stored on the local display. <b>One has to add a new event
within 30 days of the event date or the event's data will be automatically
scrubed off your disk forever. </b>

<h2> <a name="goto"> GOTO Event </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Selecting GOTO Event sends the WSDM display to the start time of
the weather event.

<h2> <a name="add"> ADD </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Selecting ADD creates a new, blank event. By default Event Manager
chooses a start time, end time and picks a default title. Select the
new event from the list and edit the fields as desired. Choosing <a
href="#save"> Save </a> commits the changes to disk and prevents data
in the new event from being erased.

<h2> <a name="delete"> Delete </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Selecting Delete removes the weather event from the list. This
change is not commited to disk until the user selects <a href="#save">
Save </a>. <em> Note: Once an event has been removed from the event list
and saved, the data for this time period will then be scrubbed from this
disk of it is more than 30 days old.  This data will not re-appear once
it has been removed from the list. Be sure you have no need for an older
event, before you remove it.

<h2> <a name="Help"> Help </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Selecting Help brings up this document.

<h2> <a name="save"> Save </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Selecting Save commits changes to disk. The Data scrubbing utiltiy;
<em>Janitor</em> uses the information saved onto disk to decide what
data to save.  user selects <a href="#save"> Save </a>.

<h2> <a name="close"> Close </a> <font size=2><a href="#Doc_Top">Back to top</a></font></h2>
<p> Selecting Close iconifys the application. Event Manager continues to
run  and can be re-opened by clicking on the icon or on the task button
in the task bar.
