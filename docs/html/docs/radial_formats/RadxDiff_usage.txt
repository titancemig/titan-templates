Usage: RadxDiff [args as below]
Options:

  [ -h ] produce this list.

  [ -ag ] aggregate sweep files into volume on read

     You must specify the same number of fields for 1 and 2
     If not specified, all fields will be compared

  [ -keep_long ] keep long range rays
                 Keep NEXRAD long-range non-Doppler sweeps
                 Default is to remove them

  [ -max_time_diff ? ] max abs time diff (secs)

  [ -max_range ? ] set max range (km)

  [ -margin ? ] time_margin (secs): defaults to 3600
     applies to all time search modes except latest

  [ -min_percent ? ] percent of bad points to trigger report
     If the percentage of bad points is less than this,
     no bad data report will be produced

  [ -no_fields ] do not check field details

  [ -no_field_names ] do not check field names
     assumes fields are in correct order

  [ -no_field_number ] do not check number of fields

  [ -no_field_units ] do not check field units

  [ -no_field_data ] do not check field data values

  [ -no_rays ] do not check ray details

  [ -no_sweeps ] do not check sweep details

  [ -no_sweep_numbers ] do not check sweep numbers

  [ -out_append ] append to output file
    Default is to write a fresh file

  [ -out_path ? ] set path for output file
    Can optionally be set to 'stdout' or 'stderr'

  [ -path1 ? ] set file1 path, see also -f1
  [ -path2 ? ] set file1 path, see also -f2

  [ -rem_short ] remove short range rays
                 Remove NEXRAD short-range Doppler sweeps

  [ -report_all ] report all gates with errors

  [ -sweep ? ] set single sweep number
               or minimum - see '-sweep_max'

  [ -sweep_max ? ] set max sweep number
                   use '-sweep' for setting minimum

  [ -time ? ] specify search time
     Format is "YYYY MM DD HH MM SS"

  [ -time_mode ? ] mode if searching by time
     Options: latest, closest, first_before, first_after

  [ -trim_sur ] trim surveillance sweeps to 360 degrees
                Remove extra rays in each surveillance sweep

  [ -vol_num ] check the volume number

  [ -v, -verbose ] print verbose debug messages
  [ -vv, -extra ] print extra verbose debug messages


TDRP args: [options as below]
   [ -params path ] specify params file path
   [ -check_params] check which params are not set
   [ -print_params [mode]] print parameters
     using following modes, default mode is 'norm'
       short:   main comments only, no help or descr
                structs and arrays on a single line
       norm:    short + descriptions and help
       long:    norm  + arrays and structs expanded
       verbose: long  + private params included
