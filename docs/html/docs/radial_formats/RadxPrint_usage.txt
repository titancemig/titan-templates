Usage: RadxPrint [args as below]
Options:

  [ -h ] produce this list.

  [ -ag ] aggregate sweep files into volume on read
          applies to DORADE and CFRADIAL sweep files

  [ -ang ? ] set single fixed angle
             or minimum - see '-ang_max'

  [ -ang_max ? ] set max fixed angle
                 use '-ang' for setting minimum

  [ -apply_georefs] apply georeference corrections on read.
    For moving platforms, measured georeference information is sometimes
    available. If so, this is applied and appropriate corrections made.
    Earth-centric azimuth and elevation angles will be computed.

  [ -change_lat_sign] change the sign of the radar latitude
    Useful for RAPIC files that always have a positive latitude.

  [ -const_ngates ] force number of gates constant for all rays
                    Added gates will be filled with missing values

  [ -data ] print field data

  [ -d, -debug ] print debug messages

  [ -dir ? ] Directory if searching by time

  [ -dorade_format ] print format of dorade structs

  [ -f ? ] set file path, see also -path

  [ -field ? ] Specify particular field
     Specify name or number
     Use muptiple -field args for multiple fields
     If not specified, all fields will be printed

  [ -margin ? ] time_margin (secs): defaults to 3600
     applies to all time search modes except latest

  [ -meta_only ] only read sweep and field meta data
     rays and data will not be read

  [ -mode ? ] mode if searching by time
     Options: latest, closest, first_before, first_after

  [ -native ] print in native format
              no translation into Radx

  [ -no_trans ] ignore rays with antenna transition flag set

  [ -path ? ] set file path, see also -f

  [ -preserve_sweeps ] preserve sweep details as they are in file.
     This generally applies to NEXRAD data - by default we
     consolidate sweeps by combining split-cut sweeps
     into a single sweep.
     If this flag is true, we leave the sweeps unchanged.

  [ -radar_num ? ] set radar number
    Applies to NOAA HRD data. LF radar = 1, TA radar = 2
    Generally not needed

  [ -rays ] print ray meta data

  [ -ray_table ] print table of ray properties

  [ -rem_miss ] remove rays in which data at all gates and
                for all fields is missing

  [ -rem_short ] remove short range rays
                 Remove NEXRAD short-range Doppler sweeps

  [ -rem_long ] remove long range rays
                Remove NEXRAD long-range Non-Doppler sweeps

  [ -rem_trans ] remove rays with antenna transitions

  [ -summary ] print summary of each ray

  [ -sweep ? ] set single sweep number
               or minimum - see '-sweep_max'

  [ -sweep_max ? ] set max sweep number
               use '-sweep' for setting minimum

  [ -time ? ] specify search time
     Format is "YYYY MM DD HH MM SS"

  [ -trim_sur ] trim surveillance sweeps to 360 degrees
                Remove extra rays in each surveillance sweep

  [ -v, -verbose ] print verbose debug messages
  [ -vv, -extra ] print extra verbose debug messages

  [ -vol_fields ] load up volume fields from rays
     If not set, fields are left managed by rays


NOTE: You do not need to use the params option (see below).
      If no params are specified, you deal with the whole file.

TDRP args: [options as below]
   [ -params/--params path ] specify params file path
   [ -check_params] check which params are not set
   [ -print_params [mode]] print parameters
     using following modes, default mode is 'norm'
       short:   main comments only, no help or descr
                structs and arrays on a single line
       norm:    short + descriptions and help
       long:    norm  + arrays and structs expanded
       verbose: long  + private params included
       short_expand:   short with env vars expanded
       norm_expand:    norm with env vars expanded
       long_expand:    long with env vars expanded
       verbose_expand: verbose with env vars expanded
   [ -tdrp_debug] debugging prints for tdrp
   [ -tdrp_usage] print this usage
