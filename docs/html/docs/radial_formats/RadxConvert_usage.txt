Usage: RadxConvert [args as below]
Options:

  [ -h ] produce this list.

  [ -ag ] aggregate sweep files into volume on read.
          Files with the SAME VOLUME NUMBER in the name are aggregated.
          Applies to CfRadial and DORADE sweep files.

  [ -ag_all ] aggregate files in input list on read.
          ALL FILES in the input list are aggregated into a volume.
          See '-f' option.
          Applies to CfRadial and DORADE sweep files.

  [ -alt ? ] override radar altitude (m)

  [ -apply_georefs] apply georeference corrections on read.
    For moving platforms, measured georeference information is sometimes
    available. If so, this is applied and appropriate corrections made.
    Earth-centric azimuth and elevation angles will be computed.

  [ -change_lat_sign] change the sign of the radar latitude
          Useful for RAPIC files that always have a positive latitude.

  [ -cfradial ] convert to cfradial (the default)

  [ -cf_classic ] output classic-style netcdf (the default)
  [ -cf_netcdf4 ] output netcdf4 style
  [ -cf_classic4 ] output classic-style netcdf4
  [ -cf_nc64bit ] output 64-bit NC netcdf
                  The above only apply to cfradial output.

  [ -const_ngates ] force number of gates constant for all rays
                    Added gates will be filled with missing values

  [ -compress ? ] compress output
                  specifiy compression level [1-9]
                  For cfradial, forces netcdf4 mode

  [ -d, -debug ] print debug messages

  [ -dorade ] convert to dorade

  [ -disag ] dis-aggregate into sweep files on write
          optional for CfRadial files
          always applies to DORADE sweep files

  [ -fixed_angle ? ] set single fixed_angle
              or minimum - see '-fixed_ang_max'

  [ -fixed_angle_max ? ] set max fixed_angle
                  use '-fixed_ang' for setting minimum

  [ -end "yyyy mm dd hh mm ss"] end time
           Sets mode to ARCHIVE

  [ -f, -paths ? ] set file paths
           Sets mode to FILELIST

  [ -field ? ] Specify particular field
     Specify name or number
     Use multiple -field args for multiple fields
     If not specified, all fields will be used

  [ -foray ] convert to FORAY-1 netcdf

  [ -force_vary ] force use of ragged arrays for CfRadial
     even if ngates is constant for all rays

  [ -indir ? ] set input directory

  [ -keep_long ] keep long range rays
                 Keep NEXRAD long-range non-Doppler sweeps
                 Default is to remove them

  [ -lat ? ] override radar latitude (deg)

  [ -lon ? ] override radar longitude (deg)

  [ -ldata ] write _latest_data_info files

  [ -max_range ? ] set max range (km)

  [ -mdv ] convert to MDV in radial coords

  [ -native ] output in host-native byte ordering
              instead of swapping into big-endian

  [ -nexrad ] convert to NEXRAD archive level 2

  [ -outdir ? ] set output directory

  [ -out_end ? ] compute output path using end time
                 default is to use both start and end times

  [ -out_start ? ] compute output path using start time
                   default is to use both start and end times

  [ -preserve_sweeps ] preserve sweep details as they are in file.
     This generally applies to NEXRAD data - by default we
     consolidate sweeps by combining split-cut sweeps
     into a single sweep.
     If this flag is true, we leave the sweeps unchanged.

  [ -radar_num ? ] set radar number
    Applies to NOAA HRD data. LF radar = 1, TA radar = 2
    Generally not needed

  [ -rem_miss ] remove rays in which data at all gates and
                for all fields is missing

  [ -rem_short ] remove short range rays
                 Remove NEXRAD short-range Doppler sweeps

  [ -rem_trans ] remove rays with antenna transitions

  [ -start "yyyy mm dd hh mm ss"] start time
           Sets mode to ARCHIVE

  [ -sweep ? ] set single sweep number
               or minimum - see '-sweep_max'

  [ -sweep_max ? ] set max sweep number
                   use '-sweep' for setting minimum

  [ -trim_sur ] trim surveillance sweeps to 360 degrees
                Remove extra rays in each surveillance sweep

  [ -uf ] convert to universal format

  [ -v, -verbose ] print verbose debug messages

  [ -vv, -extra ] print extra verbose debug messages

  [ -write_other ] option to write other fields unchanged.
    Default is that if -fields is used, only the specified fields
    will be written in the output files.


NOTE: You do not need to use the params option (see below).
      If no params are specified, you deal with the whole file.

TDRP args: [options as below]
   [ -params/--params path ] specify params file path
   [ -check_params] check which params are not set
   [ -print_params [mode]] print parameters
     using following modes, default mode is 'norm'
       short:   main comments only, no help or descr
                structs and arrays on a single line
       norm:    short + descriptions and help
       long:    norm  + arrays and structs expanded
       verbose: long  + private params included
       short_expand:   short with env vars expanded
       norm_expand:    norm with env vars expanded
       long_expand:    long with env vars expanded
       verbose_expand: verbose with env vars expanded
   [ -tdrp_debug] debugging prints for tdrp
   [ -tdrp_usage] print this usage
