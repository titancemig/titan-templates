TITAN RELEASE NOTES - 2006/09/04
================================

1. Release notes added.
-----------------------

From this date, a release notes file will detail any significant
changes to the distribution.


2. Added check_titan_libs script.
---------------------------------

After running build_titan_libs, you can run the check_titan_libs
script. This will print out error messages for any libraries which
were not successfully installed.


3. Added check_titan_apps script.
---------------------------------

After running build_titan_apps, you can run the check_titan_apps
script. This will print out error messages for any applications which
were not successfully installed.


4. Added set_build_env file.
----------------------------

The file contains the environment variables which are used by the build.

You can set this up manually with:

  source set_build_env

You can then execute parts of the build individually, to handle 
problems with specific libraries or applications.

For example, suppose the Mdv library did not install. You can:

  source ~/rap/set_build_env
  cd ~/rap/libs/Mdv
  make opt install

Then, you can check the installed libraries as follows:

  cd ~/rap
  check_titan_libs

Or suppose the MdvMerge2 application did not install. You can

  source ~/rap/set_build_env
  cd ~/rap/apps/mdv_utils/src/MdvMerge2
  make opt install

Then, you can check the installed applications as follows:

  cd ~/rap
  check_titan_apps


5. New applications.
--------------------

(a) Read in Gematronik XML radar volume, convert to Dsr:

    ~/rap/apps/ingest/src/GemVolXml2Dsr

(b) Merge radar and lightning data into a pseudo-dbz or pseudo-vil grid:

    ~/rap/apps/awc/src/combine_ltg_radar


6. Building CIDD without imlib2.
--------------------------------

I you are not able to install imlib2, which is required by the CIDD
display application (apps/cidd/src/CIDD), you can build a TITAN
version instead:

  apps/titan/src/CIDD_titan

This app does not require imlib2. The only difference is the manner
in which graphics are saved out for webcontent generation. CIDD_titan
produces .xwd files (X window dump) which must then be converted to
image formats such as .jpg and .gif using convert. CIDD has the option
of generating image files directly.

7. Build scripts.
-----------------

Fixed a bug in the tar script, so that all build scripts are correctly
copied to the top level directory.
