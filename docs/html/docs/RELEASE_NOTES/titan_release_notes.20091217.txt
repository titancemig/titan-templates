TITAN RELEASE NOTES - 2009/12/17
================================

1. Added XML output option to SpdbQuery
---------------------------------------

SpdbQuery now has the -as_xml command line option.

If specified, the output is in XML format.

2. Advanced radar support added
-------------------------------

The following lib and apps were added for advanced radar support
including time series and dual polarization:

  libs/radar
  apps/radar

Note: the fftw3 package is required for these.

The following are in apps/radar/src:

  AltCpCompute: CP method of ZDR calibration
  ChillCal2Xml: convert CHILL calibration file to XML
  ChillSdb2Dsr: read CHILL SDB server and write to DSR
  ChillSdbServer: read DSR, serve out as CHILL SDB
  ChillTsFile2Fmq: read CHILL time series file, write to time series FMQ
  ChillTsTcp2Fmq: read CHILL time series server, write to time series FMQ
  CP2Udp2Fmq: read CP2 UDP time series, write to time series FMQ
  Dsr2CP2Mom: read DSR, write out as CP2 UDP moments
  Dsr2Rapic: read DSR, write out as BOM RAPIC
  DsrGrabber: read DSR, print summary statistics
  DualDopplerLobes: create CIDD map for Dual Doppler
  IntfRemove: remove interference using power only
  Iq2Dsr: read time-series FMQ, compute moments, write to DSR
  Mdv2Vad: read MDV polar file, compute VAD, write to SPDB
  MdvPartRain: read MDV dual-pol polar file, compute PID and rain rate
  MdvRadarShear: read MDV polar file, compute radial and azimuthal shear
  PartRain: read dual pol DSR, compute PID and rain rate, write to DSR
  RadarCal: compute radar calibration
  RadarConst: compute radar constant
  RadarMdvCompare: compare overlap regions, compute DBZ bias
  RapMap2Chill: convert CIDD map to CHILL map format
  SpectraPlot: display spectra from time series (in SPDB)
  SpectraPrint: read time series data, write to SPDB
  SunCal: compute calibration from sun scan
  TsCalAuto: drive siggen, compute radar calibration
  TsFile2Fmq: read time series file, write to time series FMQ
  TsFmq2Tcp: read time series FMQ, serve out via TCP
  TsPrint: read time series FMQ or files, print stats
  TsSmartSave: read time series FMQ, save out to files
  TsTcp2File: read time series TCP, save to file
  TsTcp2Fmq: read time series TCP, write to FMQ
  UfRadarPrint: print UF radar format file
  VertCompute: compute ZDR bias from vertical pointing scanning

3. Jadeite JAVA display
-----------------------

The prototype Java-based Jadeite display was added. This will
eventually replace CIDD.
