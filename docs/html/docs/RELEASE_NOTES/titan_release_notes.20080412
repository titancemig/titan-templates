TITAN RELEASE NOTES - 2008/04/12
================================

1. Added compile arguments for large file support.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are using a 32-bit version of LINUX, you will use the
default value for HOST_OS:

  setev HOST_OS LINUX

In make_include/rap_make.LINUX, the following compile flags have
been added for LFS - large file support:

  -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

This supports file sizes of above 2GB.

2. CIDD Makefile
----------------

Depending on the OS you are using, CIDD may not link because of
library dependencies.

In the CIDD Makefile, you will see the following:

# Use following line instead, if -lpng -ltiff -ljpeg -lgif -lz not available
#   -lshapelib -lImlib2 -lpthread -lguidexv -lxview -lolgx -lX11 -lXext -lm

If you are having trouble, delete the line above these comments, as well
as the first line of the comments. Then, uncomment the second line and
try linking with that.

3. Requires ImLib2.
-------------------

CIDD under this distribution requires ImLib2.

CIDD_titan is not dependent on ImLib2. This application can be used
instead of CIDD for many purposes. However, the image generation from
CIDD_titan is less capable than from CIDD.

4. Support for new NEXRAD formats
---------------------------------

See:

  apps/ingest/src/superResNexradII2Dsr
  apps/ingest/src/superResNexradLdmUnzip

for applications to support the latest NEXRAD format changes
for so-called super-resolution.

5. Rview/TimeHist
-----------------

The time scale GUI for TimeHist has been updated.

(a) There is now a '1HR' buttton which moves the time back
and forward by 1 hour.

(b) If no TITAN data is available, the TimeHist TIME button moves
the time back and forward by scan_delta_t, in secs. See the Rview
parameter file for scan_delta_t.

6. apps/radar
-------------

There are a number of new applications in apps/radar. These are under
development, but may be useful.

  ChillSdbServer: serve out CHILL SDB moments from Dsr queue
  DsrGrabber: reads Dsr, writes out ASCII summary
  RadarConst: computes radar constant
  RadarMdvCompare: compare overlap regions between radars, to compare
                   reflectivity calibration
  RapMap2Chill: convert TITAN maps to CHILL maps
